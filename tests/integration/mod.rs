//! Integration tests for the AI Gateway.
//! 
//! These tests make real requests to the AI providers via the gateway and verify the responses.
//! They also check that the metrics are correctly sent to ElasticSearch.
//! 
//! # Running the tests
//! 
//! To run the tests, you need to:
//! 
//! 1. Start the AI Gateway locally: `cargo run`
//! 2. Create a `.env.test` file with your API keys and ElasticSearch configuration
//! 3. Run the tests with: `cargo test --test integration -- --nocapture`
//! 
//! The tests assume that ElasticSearch is configured in your gateway.
